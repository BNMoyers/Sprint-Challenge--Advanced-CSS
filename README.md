Edit this document to include your answers after each question. Make sure to leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read by your project manager

1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

adaptive websites have set breakpoints; when the width of the viewport reaches preset min/max widths, the design 'snaps' to its next state. 

fully responsive websites, however, move WITH the viewport, changing size dynamically. -->

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

mobile vs desktop first refers to which platform the developer has in mind when create the initial layout. mobile first sites are designed for view on smaller devices, and then (possibly) adapted to display nicely on a full-sized monitor. 

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?

setting the font-size to 62.5% will, on a browser's default settings, make the font 10px. This moves rem's math from base 8 to base 10, which is much easier on our end!

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

preprocessing is like buying a fancy, three-ring binder with folders and dividers already in it, rather than a plain spiral-bound notebook. Sure, you can customize both of them. But the binder comes with stuff that makes it easier and gives you more flexability. 

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

The best part is having different files to organize each section of my css, while still being able to compile it into one clean sheet. 

The part I had the most trouble with was getting yarn to cooperate with windows. I'm still having trouble sorting that out.
